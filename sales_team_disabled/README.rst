Sales Team Disabled
===================

This module avoids more than one Sales Teams to be created or removed.
Sales Teams can only be archived/unarchived.
This module also ensures that at least one and only one Sales Team is active.

To avoid Sales Teams menus and fields being displayed, use this module in combination with:

- sales_team_disabled_crm
- sales_team_disabled_sale
