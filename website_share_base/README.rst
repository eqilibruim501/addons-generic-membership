====================
Website Share (Base)
====================

This module is automatically installed upon installation of any website_share_*
module.
It changes the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest,
email) icons in the Share website snippet replacing the FontAwesome element
with an SVG image.
This is done for ensuring all icons in that block share a similar look and
behavior, and it's made necessary because other Social Media don't have a
FontAwesome icon in the version used by Odoo.
