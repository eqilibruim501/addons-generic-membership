Website Share Filter Option Mastodon
====================================

This module merges the functionalities introduced by modules
website_share_mastodon and website_share_filter_option_technical, in order to
introduce a new sharing option (for Mastodon) on website settings. The button
"Share on Mastodon" will thus only be visible on those websites for which it is
allowed.
