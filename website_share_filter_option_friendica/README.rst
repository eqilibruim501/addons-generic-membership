Website Share Filter Option Friendica
=====================================

This module merges the functionalities introduced by modules
website_share_friendica and website_share_filter_option_technical, in order to
introduce a new sharing option (for Friendica) on website settings. The button
"Share on Friendica" will thus only be visible on those websites for which it
is allowed.
