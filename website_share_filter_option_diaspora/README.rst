Website Share Filter Option Diaspora
====================================

This module merges the functionalities introduced by modules
website_share_diaspora and website_share_filter_option_technical, in order to
introduce a new sharing option (for Diaspora) on website settings. The button
"Share on Diaspora" will thus only be visible on those websites for which it is
allowed.
