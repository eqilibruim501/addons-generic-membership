Website Share Filter Option Telegram
====================================

This module merges the functionalities introduced by modules
website_share_telegram and website_share_filter_option_technical, in order to
introduce a new sharing option (for Telegram) on website settings. The button
"Share on Telegram" will thus only be visible on those websites for which it is
allowed.
