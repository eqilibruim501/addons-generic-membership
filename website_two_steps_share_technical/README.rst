Website Two-Steps Share Technical
=================================

N.B.:
This is a technical module: it doesn't introduce new features at user-side.
Rather, it implements functionalities and interfaces for other modules to use.

Besides centralized social media (e.g.: Facebook, Twitter, etc.) which are
always reachable at the same domain, on the web there also exist many other
services which can run on custom servers, each with its own domain (e.g.:
Mastodon, Wordpress, etc.).
If a visitor of the website wants to share a Website content on such a service,
it must first declare what is the domain of the server hosting the service.

This module introduces this two-steps sharing process on Odoo website, as an
interface that other modules can use when introducing a share functionality
towards a decentralized service.
